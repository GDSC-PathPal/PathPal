1. users can receive voice guidance for the route when they enter thier starting and arraival point.
2. If user is heading a correct starting direction, navigation will begin with vibration.
3. results of the camera screen analyzed by stride of the visually impaired person, will be announced through voice and vibration.
4. In the example screen, you can receive voice guidance such as, “crosswalk in the center and bollard on the right detected”

# ‣ Key Features

## Navigation
- Current location and heading Management
- Voice search for starting and destination
- Setting the correct starting direction using a compass

<br>

## Vision Assistance
- Voice guidance on objects and their locations shown on the camera screen
  - Detectable objects : beverage vending machine, bicycle road, braille sign, brailleblock, chair, resting place, lift , crosswalk, trashcan, green traffic
- Vibration guidance when detecting an accident-causing obstacle
  - Detectable Risks : block kind bad, raised curb, Pillar, bollard, barricade
